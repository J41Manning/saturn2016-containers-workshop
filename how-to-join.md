Interested in exploring the what and why of containers and their implications on software architecture?  Here is how you can become a participant in the workshop:

1. Contact one of the workshop organizers.
2. Prepare a brief "position paper" containing your ideas, questions, and experiences and submit it to the workshop by forking this workshop repository in GitHub and issuing a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with your position paper included.
3. [Register for the SATURN 2016 conference](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/saturn/2016/registration.cfm).

You must have RSVP'd to the workshop by April 1, 2016 to participate.  Position papers are due by April 13, 2016.

## Position Papers

What should be included in your position paper?  A variety of possible ideas could be appropriate.  [See the list of thinking questions to help get you started](/questions.md).  The main point of a position paper is to create a starting off point for planning workshop activities.

Some ideas for what to put in a position paper:
* Explain a **personal experience** - positive and/or negative.
* Describe some **specific problems** that you've encountered when designing or building systems that might have been caused by (or perhaps could be solved by) adopting containers.
* Describe some of your own **philosophy** regarding architecture thinking or software design to contribute to the discussion.
* **Ask some questions** -- What are you most curious or concerned or excited or confused or ... about architecting within the context of a containerized world?  Oftentimes a good question is more valuable than 100 answers.

All workshop material will be published to the GitHub repository including write-ups, images, and position papers.  You can see the [outcomes from the SATURN 2015 workshop for a taste of what this one will be like](https://github.com/michaelkeeling/SATURN2015-Microservices-Workshop).
