# Some Questions for Thought


## Understanding new Abstractions

* What is a container?  Is there a practical definition?  Is this definition sufficient for architectural reasoning or is a different definition required?
* What are the key abstractions to understand containerization?
* Are there design concepts or ideas that are common across vendor specific implementations?
* How are containers different than frameworks?  When should each be used?

## Reasoning about the System

* What quality attributes matter in a containerized world?  What properties are promoted?  Inhibited?
* What views do containers help with?
* Are existing architectural styles sufficient as defined?
* What are the benefits of containers?  Who gets those benefits?

## Implementation Concerns

* What development practices and team organization are assumed when using container-based allocation patterns?
* What is the connection with DevOps?  Ho much DevOps maturity is required? Suggested? Optional?
* What is the connection to cloud allocation and deployment patterns?
